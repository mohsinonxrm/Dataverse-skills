# Skill: Init

> **Environment-First Rule** — All metadata (solutions, columns, tables, forms, views) and plugin registrations are created **in the Dynamics environment** via API or scripts, then pulled into the repo. Never write or edit solution XML by hand to create new components. This rule applies to every step in both scenarios below.

**Execute every numbered step in order.** Do not skip ahead to a later step, even if it appears more relevant to the user's immediate goal.

**MCP setup exception:** MCP configuration (step 5 in Scenario A, step 3's MCP part in Scenario B) requires a Claude Code restart, which loses all session context. Therefore:
- **Skip MCP setup entirely** if an MCP server is already configured (`.mcp.json` exists with a Dataverse server entry, or `claude mcp list` shows one).
- **Defer MCP setup to the very last step** — after all scripts have been created and run, all metadata is live, and commits are done. This way the restart only loses the "done" state, not in-progress work.
- Before triggering the restart, **write a brief status summary to `CLAUDE.md`** (or append to existing) so the next session knows what was completed.

Two scenarios — handle both.

---

## Scenario A: New Machine (repo already exists)

The repo is already cloned. Scripts and CLAUDE.md are present. Only machine-local config is missing.

### 1. Check what's already there

```
ls .env 2>/dev/null && echo "found" || echo "missing"
ls .vscode/settings.json 2>/dev/null && echo "found" || echo "missing"
ls .mcp.json 2>/dev/null && echo "found" || echo "missing"
```

### 2. Discover TENANT_ID automatically

If the user does not know their TENANT_ID, derive it from the Dataverse environment URL — no portal login required:

```bash
curl -sI https://<org>.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/ \
  | grep -i "WWW-Authenticate" \
  | sed -n 's|.*login\.microsoftonline\.com/\([^/]*\).*|\1|p'
```

The output is the tenant GUID. Use it directly in `.env`.

### 3. Create .env if missing

Ask the user for each value, then write the file:

```
DATAVERSE_URL=https://<org>.crm.dynamics.com
TENANT_ID=<guid>
SOLUTION_NAME=<UniqueName>
PUBLISHER_PREFIX=<prefix>
PAC_AUTH_PROFILE=nonprod
CLIENT_ID=<app-registration-client-id>
CLIENT_SECRET=<app-registration-secret>
```

How to prompt the user:
- `DATAVERSE_URL`: "What is your Dataverse environment URL?"
- `TENANT_ID`: Auto-discover from the URL above before asking. Only ask if discovery fails.
- `SOLUTION_NAME`: "What is the unique name of your solution?"
- `PUBLISHER_PREFIX`: Do **not** ask yet — this is discovered in the solution creation step (step 7 in Scenario B). Leave it blank in `.env` for now; the `create_solution.py` script will query existing publishers and ask the user. Once confirmed, update `.env` with the chosen prefix.
- `CLIENT_ID` / `CLIENT_SECRET`: Only needed for service principal auth. If the user authenticates via browser (interactive login), skip these. When omitted, auth.py uses interactive device code flow with AuthenticationRecord persistence (no browser re-prompt on subsequent runs).

Write the file directly — do not instruct the user to create it:

```python
# Write .env
with open(".env", "w") as f:
    f.write(f"DATAVERSE_URL={dataverse_url}\n")
    f.write(f"TENANT_ID={tenant_id}\n")
    f.write(f"SOLUTION_NAME={solution_name}\n")
    f.write(f"PUBLISHER_PREFIX=\n")  # filled in during solution creation step
    f.write(f"PAC_AUTH_PROFILE=nonprod\n")
    if client_id:
        f.write(f"CLIENT_ID={client_id}\n")
    if client_secret:
        f.write(f"CLIENT_SECRET={client_secret}\n")
```

### 4. Ensure sensitive files are gitignored

Write a comprehensive `.gitignore` that covers all credential and generated files:

```python
GITIGNORE_ENTRIES = [
    ".env",
    ".vscode/settings.json",
    ".claude/mcp_settings.json",
    ".token_cache.bin",
    "*.snk",
    "__pycache__/",
    "*.pyc",
    "solutions/*.zip",
    "plugins/**/bin/",
    "plugins/**/obj/",
]

gitignore = open(".gitignore").read() if os.path.exists(".gitignore") else ""
missing = [e for e in GITIGNORE_ENTRIES if e not in gitignore]
if missing:
    with open(".gitignore", "a") as f:
        f.write("\n" + "\n".join(missing) + "\n")
```

### 5. Ensure PAC CLI is on PATH

Find the path (this may be slow, wait for it to finish):

```bash
find /c/Users/$USER/AppData/Local/Microsoft/PowerAppsCLI -name "pac.exe" 2>/dev/null
find /c/Users/$USER/.dotnet/tools -name "pac" 2>/dev/null
```

Add to `~/.bashrc` (for Git Bash / Claude Code):

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/c/Users/$USER/.dotnet/tools"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 6. Connect to the environment

Ask the user which environment they are setting up for. Do not assume.

Check whether a connection already exists for that environment:

```
pac auth list
pac org who
```

If a matching profile already exists, select it:

```
pac auth select --name <profile-name>
```

If no connection exists yet, create one. Name the profile after the environment it targets (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) — not a generic name. **A browser window will open — sign in with your Microsoft account when prompted:**

```
pac auth create --name <profile-name>
```

For service principal auth (non-interactive, used in CI):

```
pac auth create --name <profile-name> \
  --applicationId <CLIENT_ID> \
  --clientSecret <CLIENT_SECRET> \
  --tenant <TENANT_ID>
```

> **Multi-environment repos:** If the team deploys to multiple environments from the same repo, each developer's `.env` represents their current target. Consider `.env.dev`, `.env.staging`, etc., with a pattern like `cp .env.dev .env` to switch targets. Each developer manages their own local `.env`.

### 7. Verify the connection

```
pac org who
python scripts/auth.py
```

Both should succeed without error. Confirm the environment URL in the output matches the intended target.

### 8. Configure MCP server (if not already configured)

**Skip this step entirely** if any of the following are true:
- `.mcp.json` already exists and contains a Dataverse server entry
- `claude mcp list` shows a `dataverse-*` server already registered
- The user's immediate task does not require MCP (e.g., they asked to create tables, import data, or build a solution — all of which use the SDK or PAC CLI, not MCP)

If MCP is needed and not yet configured, use the `dataverse-mcp-configure` skill. **This is always the last step** because `claude mcp add` requires a Claude Code restart, which ends the current session.

Before triggering the MCP install command, inform the user:

> MCP setup requires restarting Claude Code. All other setup steps are complete.
> After restart, you can verify MCP works by asking: "List the tables in my Dataverse environment."

New machine setup is complete.

---

## Scenario B: First Time (new project, empty repo)

All commands below can be run directly by Claude — the user does not need to copy-paste or execute anything manually unless they want to.

### 0. Determine scope

Before doing anything, determine what the user actually needs:

- **Explore only** — they want to connect to an existing environment and browse/query data (e.g. "list tables", "query records", "connect to my environment"). Do steps 1–6 then jump to step 11 (MCP). Skip steps 7–10 entirely.
- **Build a project** — they want to create tables, solutions, custom schema, or deploy code. Do all steps.

If the user's intent is not clear, ask:

> Are you setting up a new development project (creating tables, solutions, custom schema), or do you just want to connect and explore an existing environment?

Use the answer to decide whether to run steps 7–10.

### 1. Confirm the repo

Verify you are at the repo root.

### 2. Discover TENANT_ID

Always ask the user to confirm the Dataverse environment URL and pause to let the user respond even if you can derive it from `pac auth list` or other sources.

Do not perform any subsequent or parallel operations until the user answers. Do not assume.

Before writing `.env`, auto-discover `TENANT_ID` from the Dataverse URL confirmed by the user:

```bash
curl -sI https://<org>.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/ \
  | grep -i "WWW-Authenticate" \
  | sed -n 's|.*login\.microsoftonline\.com/\([^/]*\).*|\1|p'
```

Use the resulting GUID as `TENANT_ID` in `.env`. Only ask the user if this command fails.

### 3. Create .env and .gitignore

Follow steps 3–4 from Scenario A above. Ask the user for SOLUTION_NAME if not already known (but use the DATAVERSE_URL you obtained and confirmed in step 2).

### 4. Create the directory structure

```
mkdir -p solutions plugins scripts
```

Copy plugin scripts into the repo so they're committed and available to teammates:

```
cp .dataverse/scripts/auth.py scripts/
cp .dataverse/scripts/enable-mcp-client.py scripts/
```

### 5. Write CLAUDE.md

Copy `templates/CLAUDE.md` from the plugin to the repo root. Replace placeholders:
- `{{DATAVERSE_URL}}` → environment URL
- `{{SOLUTION_NAME}}` → solution unique name
- `{{PUBLISHER_PREFIX}}` → leave as `TBD` for now (filled in after step 7 when the publisher is confirmed)
- `{{PAC_AUTH_PROFILE}}` → `nonprod`

### 6. Connect to the environment

Ask the user which environment this new project targets. Do not assume.

Check whether a connection already exists:

```
pac auth list
pac org who
```

If a matching profile appears, select it:

```
pac auth select --name <profile-name>
```

If not, connect now. Name the profile after the environment (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`). **A browser window will open — sign in with your Microsoft account when prompted:**

```
pac auth create --name <profile-name>
```

Continue to the next steps.

### 7. Create the solution and metadata in the environment *(build-project only — skip if explore only)*

**This is where changes go into Dynamics first — never into the repo directly.**

Write and run `scripts/create_solution.py` to create the publisher and solution in the environment using the Python SDK. The script **must** follow the publisher discovery flow from the `dataverse-solution` skill:

1. **Query existing publishers** in the environment (excluding Microsoft system publishers)
2. **If a custom publisher exists**, show it to the user and ask: "Should I reuse this publisher (prefix: `<prefix>_`)?"
3. **If no custom publisher exists**, ask the user: "What publisher prefix should I use? (e.g., `contoso`, `sa`, `lit` — 2-8 lowercase chars, not `new`)"
4. **Never hardcode a prefix.** Never default to `new`. Always get user confirmation.
5. After the publisher is confirmed/created, **update `.env`** with `PUBLISHER_PREFIX=<chosen_prefix>`

Run it:

```
python scripts/create_solution.py
```

Then write and run any scripts needed to create tables, columns, or other metadata. **All custom schema names must use the confirmed publisher prefix** (from `PUBLISHER_PREFIX` in `.env`). Each script should use the SDK with `solution=SOLUTION` so changes are automatically included in the solution. Run them:

```
python scripts/create_tables.py
```

### 8. Pull the environment state to the repo *(build-project only — skip if explore only)*

**After all changes are live in the environment, pull them into the repo:**

```
pac solution export --name <SOLUTION_NAME> --path ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>.zip --managed false
pac solution unpack --zipfile ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>.zip --folder ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>
rm ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>.zip
```

### 9. Load demo data *(optional, build-project only — skip if explore only)*

If the user wants sample data for testing (accounts, contacts, opportunities), use the built-in Dataverse sample data feature:

```python
from PowerPlatform.Dataverse.client import DataverseClient
from auth import get_credential, load_env
import requests, os

load_env()
env_url = os.environ["DATAVERSE_URL"].rstrip("/")

# Check if already installed
client = DataverseClient(base_url=env_url, credential=get_credential())
pages = client.records.get(
    "organization",
    select=["friendlyname", "sampledataimported"],
    top=1,
)
orgs = [o for page in pages for o in page]
if orgs and orgs[0].get("sampledataimported"):
    print("Demo data is already installed.")
else:
    # Install via Web API action (SDK doesn't support unbound actions)
    from auth import get_token
    token = get_token()
    resp = requests.post(
        f"{env_url}/api/data/v9.2/InstallSampleData",
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
            "OData-MaxVersion": "4.0",
            "OData-Version": "4.0",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
    )
    resp.raise_for_status()
    print("Demo data installation started. Takes 2-10 minutes.")
```

To remove demo data later, call `UninstallSampleData` the same way.

### 10. Commit *(build-project only — skip if explore only)*

```
git add .gitignore CLAUDE.md solutions/ plugins/ scripts/
git commit -m "chore: initialize Dataverse workspace"
```

### 11. Configure MCP server (if not already configured)

**Skip this step entirely** if any of the following are true:

- `.mcp.json` already exists and contains a Dataverse server entry
- `claude mcp list` shows a `dataverse-*` server already registered
- The user's immediate task does not require MCP (e.g., they asked to create tables, import data, or build a solution — all of which use the SDK or PAC CLI, not MCP)

If MCP is needed and not yet configured, use the `dataverse-mcp-configure` skill. **This is always the last step** because `claude mcp add` requires a Claude Code restart, which ends the current session.

Before triggering the MCP install command, inform the user:

> MCP setup requires restarting Claude Code. All other setup steps are complete — your solution, tables, and scripts are committed.
> After restart, you can verify MCP works by asking: "List the tables in my Dataverse environment."

---

## MCP Server Verification

After configuring the MCP server, verify it works by asking the agent: *"List the tables in my Dataverse environment."*

If the agent calls `list_tables` directly, MCP is connected. If it falls back to PAC CLI or Web API, the MCP server is not connected — check:

1. `.mcp.json` (Claude Code) or `.vscode/settings.json` (Copilot) exists and has correct values
2. `CLIENT_ID`/`CLIENT_SECRET`/`TENANT_ID` in the config match a valid service principal
3. The service principal has been granted access to the environment

### MCP Server Capabilities

| Task | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Create/read/update/delete data records | MCP server |
| Create a new table | MCP server |
| Explore what tables/columns exist | MCP server (`list_tables`, `describe_table`) |
| Add a column to an existing table | Web API (see `dataverse-metadata`) |
| Create a relationship / lookup | Web API (see `dataverse-metadata`) |
| Create or modify a form | Web API (see `dataverse-metadata`) |
| Create or modify a view | Web API (see `dataverse-metadata`) |

For anything beyond data CRUD and basic table operations, use the Web API directly.
