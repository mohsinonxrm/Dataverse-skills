# Configure Dataverse MCP for GitHub Copilot or Claude

This skill configures the Dataverse MCP server for GitHub Copilot or Claude with your organization's environment URL. Each organization is registered with a unique server name based on the org identifier (e.g., `DataverseMcporgbc9a965c`). 

If at any point during the MCP configuration process you discover that the user has not initialized the Dataverse workspace yet, offer to do that first using the `dataverse-init` skill, which will set up the necessary environment variables. If they refuse, remind them to do that later when then attempt any operations that require PAC CLI, Python SDK or OData Web API instead of MCP.

The parameters for the MCP server should be determined from context or environment variables where possible, and interactive prompts should only be used when it cannot be done.

## Instructions

### 0. Determine which tool to configure

Determine whether needs to configure MCP for GitHub Copilot or for Claude Code:
- If explicitly mentioned in prompt, use that.
- Otherwise, determine which tool the user is running from the context.
- Only if choosing based on the context is impossible, ask the user:

> Which tool would you like to configure the Dataverse MCP server for?
> 1. **GitHub Copilot**
> 2. **Claude**

Based on the result, set the `TOOL_TYPE` variable to either `copilot` or `claude`. Store this for use in all subsequent steps.

Set the `MCP_CLIENT_ID` variable in `.env` based on the tool choice:
- If `copilot`: `MCP_CLIENT_ID` = `aebc6443-996d-45c2-90f0-388ff96faa56`
- If `claude`: `MCP_CLIENT_ID` = `0c412cc3-0dd6-449b-987f-05b053db9457`
- If `claude` and the VSCode extension is used: set it to the same value as `CLIENT_ID` if already set, otherwise offer to create a new app registration following Scenario A, step 7 in the `dataverse-init` skill.

### 1. Determine the MCP scope

Choose the configuration scope based on the tool. Use the scope explicitly mentioned by the user, or choose the default without asking to confirm it.

**If TOOL_TYPE is `copilot`:**

The options are:
1. **Globally** (default, available in all projects)
2. **Project-only** (available only in this project)

Based on the scope, set the `CONFIG_PATH` variable:
- **Global**: `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` (use the user's home directory)
- **Project**: `.mcp/copilot/mcp.json` (relative to the current working directory)

Store this path for use in steps 2 and 6.

**If TOOL_TYPE is `claude`:**

The options are:
1. **User** (available in all projects for this user)
2. **Project** (default, available only in this project)
3. **Local** (scoped to current project directory)

Based on the scope, set the `CLAUDE_SCOPE` variable:
- **User**: `CLAUDE_SCOPE` = `user`
- **Project**: `CLAUDE_SCOPE` = `project`
- **Local**: `CLAUDE_SCOPE` = `local`

Store this value for use in step 6.

### 2. Check already-configured MCP servers

**If TOOL_TYPE is `copilot`:**

Read the MCP configuration file at `CONFIG_PATH` (determined in step 1) to check for already-configured servers.

The configuration file is a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ServerName1": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://example.com/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Or it may use `"servers"` instead of `"mcpServers"` as the top-level key.

Extract all `url` values from the configured servers and store them as `CONFIGURED_URLS`. For example:

```json
["https://orgfbb52bb7.crm.dynamics.com/api/mcp"]
```

If the file doesn't exist or is empty, treat `CONFIGURED_URLS` as empty (`[]`). This step must never block the skill.

**If TOOL_TYPE is `claude`:**

Skip this step - Claude uses CLI commands to manage MCP servers, so we don't need to check existing configuration.

### 3. Determine the environment URL

If the user provided a URL via command parameters it is: '$ARGUMENTS'. If the user mentioned the URL in the prompt, use it. Otherwise, take the URL from the `DATAVERSE_URL` variable in `.env`. If you have the URL, skip to step 4.

If the file or the variable doesn't exist, the user has not initialized the Dataverse workspace yet. Offer to do that first using the `dataverse-init` skill, which will set up the necessary environment variables. If they refuse, remind them to do that later when then attempt any operations that require PAC CLI, Python SDK or OData Web API instead of MCP, and ask the user:

> How would you like to provide your Dataverse environment URL?
> 1. **Auto-discover** — List available environments from your Azure account (requires Azure CLI)
> 2. **Manual entry** — Enter the URL directly

Based on their choice:
- If **Auto-discover**: Proceed to step 3a
- If **Manual entry**: Skip to step 3b

### 3a. Auto-discover environments

> **Note:** This lists environments accessible to the currently signed-in Azure account. Ask the user: "Is this the same account you use to access Dataverse?" If not, skip to step 3b and ask for the URL directly.

**Check prerequisites:**
- Verify Azure CLI (`az`) is installed (check with `which az` or `where az` on Windows)
- If not installed, inform the user and fall back to step 3b

**Make the API call:**

1. Check if the user is logged into Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   az account show
   ```
   If this fails, prompt the user to log in:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. Get an access token for the Power Apps API:
   ```bash
   az account get-access-token --resource https://service.powerapps.com/ --query accessToken --output tsv
   ```

3. Call the Power Apps API to list environments:
   ```
   GET https://api.powerapps.com/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/environments?api-version=2016-11-01
   Authorization: Bearer {token}
   Accept: application/json
   ```

4. Parse the JSON response and filter for environments where `properties?.linkedEnvironmentMetadata?.instanceUrl` is not null.

5. For each matching environment, extract:
   - `properties.displayName` as `displayName`
   - `properties.linkedEnvironmentMetadata.instanceUrl` (remove trailing slash) as `instanceUrl`

6. Create a list of environments in this format:
   ```json
   [
     { "displayName": "My Org (default)", "instanceUrl": "https://orgfbb52bb7.crm.dynamics.com" },
     { "displayName": "Another Env", "instanceUrl": "https://orgabc123.crm.dynamics.com" }
   ]
   ```

**If the API call succeeds**, present the environments as a numbered list. For each environment, check whether any URL in `CONFIGURED_URLS` starts with that environment's `instanceUrl` — if so, append **(already configured)** to the line.

> I found the following Dataverse environments on your account. Which one would you like to configure?
>
> 1. My Org (default) — `https://orgfbb52bb7.crm.dynamics.com` **(already configured)**
> 2. Another Env — `https://orgabc123.crm.dynamics.com`
>
> Enter the number of your choice, or type "manual" to enter a URL yourself.

If the user selects an already-configured environment, confirm that they want to re-register it (e.g. to change the endpoint type) before proceeding.

If the user types "manual", fall back to step 3b.

**If the API call fails** (user not logged in, network error, no environments found, or any other error), tell the user what went wrong and fall back to step 3b.

### 3b. Manual entry — ask for the URL

Ask the user to provide their environment URL directly:

> Please enter your Dataverse environment URL.
>
> Example: `https://myorg.crm10.dynamics.com`
>
> You can find this in the Power Platform Admin Center under Environments.

Then proceed to step 4. 

### 4. Remember the selected URL

Take the URL determined in step 3 (from context, `.env`, manual entry or `instanceUrl` in list from API) and strip any trailing slash. This is `USER_URL` for the remainder of the skill.

### 5. Decide whether to use the "Preview" or "Generally Available (GA)" endpoint

Determine from the context which of these options the user wants to use. If they did not mention either, default to 1 (GA):

- If **Generally Available (GA)**: set `MCP_URL` to `{USER_URL}/api/mcp`
- If **Preview**: set `MCP_URL` to `{USER_URL}/api/mcp_preview`

### 6. Register the MCP server

**If TOOL_TYPE is `copilot`:**

Update the MCP configuration file at `CONFIG_PATH` (determined in step 1) to add the new server.

**Generate a unique server name** from the `USER_URL`:
1. Extract the subdomain (organization identifier) from the URL
   - Example: `https://orgbc9a965c.crm10.dynamics.com` → `orgbc9a965c`
2. Prepend `DataverseMcp` to create the server name
   - Example: `DataverseMcporgbc9a965c`

This is the `SERVER_NAME`.

**Update the configuration file:**

1. If `CONFIG_PATH` is for a **project-scoped** configuration (`.mcp/copilot/mcp.json`), ensure the directory exists first:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .mcp/copilot
   ```

2. Read the existing configuration file at `CONFIG_PATH`, or create a new empty config if it doesn't exist:
   ```json
   {}
   ```

3. Determine which top-level key to use:
   - If the config already has `"servers"`, use that
   - Otherwise, use `"mcpServers"`

4. Add or update the server entry:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "{SERVER_NAME}": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "{MCP_URL}"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Write the updated configuration back to `CONFIG_PATH` with proper JSON formatting (2-space indentation).

**Important notes:**
- Do NOT overwrite other entries in the configuration file
- Preserve the existing structure and formatting
- If `SERVER_NAME` already exists, update it with the new `MCP_URL`

**If TOOL_TYPE is `claude`:**

Generate the CLI command for the user to run. Do NOT edit any configuration files.

**Generate a unique server name** from the `USER_URL`:
1. Extract the subdomain (organization identifier) from the URL
   - Example: `https://orgbc9a965c.crm10.dynamics.com` → `orgbc9a965c`
2. Use lowercase format: `dataverse-{orgid}`
   - Example: `dataverse-orgbc9a965c`

This is the `SERVER_NAME`.

**Build the command:**

Construct the command based on `CLAUDE_SCOPE` and whether the user chose GA or Preview endpoint:

```
claude mcp add --scope {CLAUDE_SCOPE} {SERVER_NAME} -t stdio -- npx -y @microsoft/dataverse@latest mcp "{USER_URL}" {ENDPOINT_FLAG}
```

When running on Windows without WSL, wrap the `npx` call into `cmd //c` and omit the quotes around the URL:

```
claude mcp add --scope {CLAUDE_SCOPE} {SERVER_NAME} -t stdio -- cmd //c "npx -y @microsoft/dataverse@latest mcp {USER_URL} {ENDPOINT_FLAG}"
```

Where:
- `{CLAUDE_SCOPE}` is `user`, `project`, or `local` (from step 1)
- `{SERVER_NAME}` is the generated server name (e.g., `dataverse-orgbc9a965c`)
- `{USER_URL}` is the base environment URL (e.g., `https://orgbc9a965c.crm10.dynamics.com`)
- `{ENDPOINT_FLAG}` is `--preview` if the user chose Preview endpoint in step 5, otherwise omit this flag

**Example commands:**
- GA endpoint with user scope: `claude mcp add --scope user dataverse-orgbc9a965c -t stdio -- npx -y @microsoft/dataverse@latest mcp "https://orgbc9a965c.crm10.dynamics.com"`
- Preview endpoint with project scope: `claude mcp add --scope project dataverse-orgbc9a965c -t stdio -- npx -y @microsoft/dataverse@latest mcp "https://orgbc9a965c.crm10.dynamics.com" --preview`
- GA endpoint on Windows with project scope: `claude mcp add --scope project dataverse-orgbc9a965c -t stdio -- cmd //c "npx -y @microsoft/dataverse@latest mcp https://orgbc9a965c.crm10.dynamics.com"`

Store this command as `CLAUDE_COMMAND` for use in step 9.

Proceed to step 7.

### 7. Confirm admin consent is granted

List out the parameters chosen in previous steps:
- Tool type (Copilot or claude) from step 0
- Scope (list possible options based on tool) from step 1
- Environment URL from step 4
- Endpoint (GA or Preview) from step 5

Ask the user if their Azure tenant administrator has granted admin consent for the MCP client ID to access the environment (which is a one-time action). If not, provide instructions to grant consent and share the following URL with them, replacing `{TENANT_ID}` with their tenant ID from `.env` and `{MCP_CLIENT_ID}` with the client ID determined in step 0:

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT_ID}/adminconsent?client_id={MCP_CLIENT_ID}
```

### 8. Add the client ID to the allowed clients list

Before running the script, ensure the required variables are available:

1. **Ensure `.env` has `DATAVERSE_URL`, `TENANT_ID`, and `MCP_CLIENT_ID`.**

   Auto-discover `TENANT_ID` from `USER_URL` — no portal login required:
   ```bash
   curl -sI <USER_URL>/api/data/v9.2/ \
     | grep -i "WWW-Authenticate" \
     | sed -n 's|.*login\.microsoftonline\.com/\([^/]*\).*|\1|p'
   ```
   The output is the tenant GUID. Only ask the user if this command fails.

   - If `.env` exists, check whether `DATAVERSE_URL`, `TENANT_ID`, and `MCP_CLIENT_ID` are present. Add any that are missing.
   - If `.env` does not exist, create a minimal one now:
     ```
     DATAVERSE_URL=<USER_URL>
     TENANT_ID=<discovered-guid>
     MCP_CLIENT_ID=<MCP_CLIENT_ID>
     ```
   Do not ask the user — you already have all three values from steps 0, 3–4, and the curl above.

2. **Locate the script.** Check in order:
   - `scripts/enable-mcp-client.py` (present if workspace was fully initialized)
   - `.github/plugins/dataverse/scripts/enable-mcp-client.py` (always present in the plugin)

   Use whichever path exists.

Run the script to add the MCP client ID (from step 0) to the Allowed Clients list for the environment (which will require a new app registration when using the VSCode extension for Claude Code but will work with standard client IDs for Copilot and Claude CLI). Do not ask for user confirmation.

### 9. Confirm success and provide next steps

**If TOOL_TYPE is `copilot`:**

Tell the user:

> ✅ Dataverse MCP server configured for GitHub Copilot at `{MCP_URL}`.
>
> Configuration saved to: `{CONFIG_PATH}`
>
> **IMPORTANT: You must restart your editor for the changes to take effect.**
>
> Restart your editor or reload the window, then you will be able to:
> - List all tables in your Dataverse environment
> - Query records from any table
> - Create, update, or delete records
> - Explore your schema and relationships

**If TOOL_TYPE is `claude`:**

Offer to the user to install the Dataverse MCP server by running {CLAUDE_COMMAND} and, if they agree, run the command and provide the following instructions:
> To enable the MCP server, restart Claude Code.
>
> After restarting, you will be able to:
> - List all tables in your Dataverse environment
> - Query records from any table
> - Create, update, or delete records
> - Explore your schema and relationships

If you installed the MCP server, pause and give the user a chance to restart the session to enable it before proceeding. Do not perform any subsequent or parallel operations until the user responds.

Otherwise provide the command with instructions:
> To install the Dataverse MCP server, exit claude and run:
>
> ```
> {CLAUDE_COMMAND}
> ```
>
> **Optional: Validate your authentication setup first**
>
> Before running the install command, you can optionally verify your Dataverse authentication is configured correctly by running:
>
> ```
> npx -y @microsoft/dataverse@latest mcp "{USER_URL}" --validate
> ```
>
> This command will check your authentication and print any error information if issues are found.
>
> Then restart Claude Code.
>
> After restarting, you will be able to:
> - List all tables in your Dataverse environment
> - Query records from any table
> - Create, update, or delete records
> - Explore your schema and relationships

### 10. Troubleshooting

If something goes wrong, help the user check:

- The URL format is correct (`https://<org>.<region>.dynamics.com`)
- They have access to the Dataverse environment
- The environment URL matches what's shown in the Power Platform Admin Center
- Their Environment Admin has enabled "Dataverse CLI MCP" in the Allowed Clients list
- Their Environment has Dataverse MCP enabled, and if they're trying to use the preview endpoint that is enabled
- **If TOOL_TYPE is `copilot`:**
  - For project-scoped configuration, ensure the `.mcp/copilot/mcp.json` file was created successfully
  - For global configuration, check permissions on the `~/.copilot/` directory
- **If TOOL_TYPE is `claude`:**
  - Ensure the `claude` CLI is installed and available in their PATH
  - If the command fails, check that `npx` and `npm` are installed
  - After running the command, they must restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect
  - They can verify the installation with `claude mcp list`
