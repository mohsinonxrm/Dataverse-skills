# Skill: Overview — What to Use and When

This skill provides cross-cutting context that no individual skill owns: tool capabilities, UX principles, and the skill index. Per-task routing is handled by each skill's WHEN/DO NOT USE WHEN frontmatter triggers — not duplicated here.

---

## UX Principle: Natural Language First

Users should never need to invoke skills or slash commands directly. The intended workflow is:

1. Install the plugin
2. Describe what you want in plain English
3. Claude figures out the right sequence of tools, APIs, and scripts

**Example prompt:** *"I want to create an extension called IronHandle for Dynamics CRM in this Git repo folder that adds a 'nickname' column to the account table and populates it with a clever nickname every time a new account is created."*

From that single prompt, Claude should orchestrate the full sequence: check if the workspace is initialized → create metadata via Web API → write and deploy a C# plugin → pull the solution to the repo. No skill names, no commands — just intent.

Skills exist as **Claude's knowledge**, not as user-facing commands. Each skill documents how to do one thing well. Claude chains them together based on what the user describes. If a capability gap exists (e.g., prompt columns aren't programmatically creatable yet), say so honestly and suggest workarounds rather than hallucinating a path.

## Multi-Environment Rule (MANDATORY)

Pro-dev scenarios involve multiple environments (dev, test, staging, prod) and multiple sets of credentials. **Never assume** the active PAC auth profile, values in `.env`, or anything from memory or a previous session reflects the correct target for the current task.

**Before the FIRST operation that touches a specific environment** — creating a table, deploying a plugin, pushing a solution, inserting data — you MUST:

1. Show the user the environment URL you intend to use
2. Ask them to confirm it is correct
3. Run `pac org who` to verify the active connection matches

> "I'm about to make changes to `<URL>`. Is this the correct target environment?"

**Do not proceed until the user explicitly confirms.** This is the single most important safety check in the plugin. Skipping it risks making irreversible changes to the wrong environment.

Once confirmed for a session, you do not need to re-confirm for every subsequent operation in the same session against the same environment.

## What This Plugin Covers

This plugin covers **Dataverse / Power Platform development**: solutions, tables, columns, forms, views, and data operations (CRUD, bulk, analytics).

It does **not** cover:

- Power Automate flows (use the maker portal or Power Automate Management API)
- Canvas apps (use `pac canvas` or the maker portal)
- Azure infrastructure beyond what's needed for service principal setup
- Business Central or other Dynamics products

## Tool Capabilities — Which Tool for Which Job

Understanding the real limits of each tool prevents hallucinated paths. This is the one piece of context no individual skill owns.

| Tool | Use for | Does NOT support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MCP Server** | Data CRUD (create/read/update/delete records), table create/update/delete/list/describe, column add via `update_table`, keyword search, single-record fetch | Forms, Views, Relationships, Option Sets, Solutions. **Note:** table creation may timeout but still succeed — always `describe_table` before retrying. Run queries sequentially (parallel calls timeout). Column names with spaces normalize to underscores (e.g., `"Specialty Area"` → `cr9ac_specialty_area`). **SQL limitations:** The `read_query` tool uses Dataverse SQL, which does NOT support: `DISTINCT`, `HAVING`, subqueries, `OFFSET`, `UNION`, `CASE`/`IF`, `CAST`/`CONVERT`, or date functions. For analytical queries that need these (e.g., finding duplicates, unmatched records, filtered aggregates), use Python with OData or pandas — see the python-sdk skill. **Bulk operations:** MCP `create_record` creates one record at a time. For 50+ records, use the Web API `$batch` endpoint or Python SDK `CreateMultiple` instead — see the python-sdk skill. |
| **Python SDK** | Data CRUD, upsert (alternate keys), bulk create/update/upsert/delete, OData queries (select/filter/expand/orderby/top), read-only SQL, table create/delete/metadata, add/remove columns, relationship metadata CRUD (1:N, N:N, lookup fields), alternate key management, file column uploads (chunked >128MB), context manager with connection pooling | Forms, Views, global Option Sets, record association (`$ref`), custom action invocation, generic `$batch` |
| **Web API** | Everything — forms, views, relationships, option sets, columns, table definitions, unbound actions, `$ref` association | Nothing (full MetadataService + OData access) |
| **PAC CLI** | Solution export/import/pack/unpack, environment create/list/delete/reset, auth profile management, plugin updates (`pac plugin push` — first-time registration requires Web API), user/role assignment (`pac admin assign-user`), solution component management | Data CRUD, metadata creation (tables/columns/forms) |
| **Azure CLI** | App registrations, service principals, credential management | Dataverse-specific operations |
| **GitHub CLI** | Repo management, GitHub secrets, Actions workflow status | Dataverse-specific operations |

**When in doubt:** MCP for conversational data work (single records, simple queries) → Python SDK for scripted data, bulk operations, and analysis → Web API for metadata the SDK doesn't cover → PAC CLI for solution lifecycle.

**Volume guidance:** MCP `create_record` is fine for 1–50 records. For 50–1000 records, use Web API `$batch` (see python-sdk skill). For 1000+ records, use Python SDK `CreateMultiple`. For data profiling and analytics beyond simple GROUP BY, use Python with pandas (see python-sdk skill).

Note: The Python SDK is in **preview** — breaking changes possible.

## Available Skills

Each skill's frontmatter contains WHEN/DO NOT USE WHEN triggers that Claude uses for automatic routing. This index is for human reference only.

| Skill | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| **init** | Workspace setup: `.env`, MCP config, directory structure, demo data |
| **setup** | Machine setup: install tools (PAC CLI, .NET, Python), authenticate |
| **metadata** | Create/modify tables, columns, relationships, forms, views via Web API |
| **python-sdk** | Data CRUD, bulk ops, OData queries, file uploads, bulk import, data profiling, notebook analysis via Python SDK |
| **solution** | Solution create/export/import/pack/unpack, post-import validation |
| **mcp-configure** | Configure Dataverse MCP server for GitHub Copilot or Claude Code as part of `init` |

---

## Scripts

The plugin ships utility scripts in `scripts/`:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `auth.py` | Azure Identity token/credential acquisition — used by all other scripts and the SDK |
| `enable-mcp-client.py` | Add the MCP Client ID to the list of allowed MCP clients in Dataverse |

For data operations and post-import validation, use the Python SDK directly (inline in your own scripts). See the `python-sdk` skill for SDK patterns and the `solution` skill for validation queries.

Any Web API call that goes beyond a one-off query should be written as a Python script and committed to `/scripts/`. Use `scripts/auth.py` for token acquisition.

---

## Before Any Metadata Change: Confirm Solution

Before creating tables, columns, or other metadata, ensure a solution exists to contain the work:

1. Ask the user: "What solution should these components go into?"
2. If a solution name is in `.env` (`SOLUTION_NAME`), confirm it with the user
3. If no solution exists yet, create one (see the `solution` skill)
4. Use the `MSCRM.SolutionName` header on all Web API metadata calls to auto-add components

Creating metadata without a solution means it exists only in the default solution and cannot be cleanly exported or deployed. Always solution-first.

---

## After Any Change: Pull to Repo (MANDATORY)

Any time you make a metadata change (via MCP, Web API, or the maker portal), **you must** end the session by pulling:

```bash
pac solution export --name <SOLUTION_NAME> --path ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>.zip --managed false
pac solution unpack --zipfile ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>.zip --folder ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>
rm ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>.zip
git add ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>
git commit -m "feat: <description>"
git push
```

The repo is always the source of truth.
